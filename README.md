## CSTM Prep

This repository documents my preparation for the CSTM certification through structured, concept-first learning and practical reinforcement. The focus is on building strong technical foundations across core cybersecurity domains.

### 🎯 Approach

- Concept-first understanding  
- Practical reinforcement through labs (Immersive Labs, DVWA, HTB-style environments)   
- Methodology development and structured note-taking
